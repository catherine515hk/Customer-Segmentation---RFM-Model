# Customer-Segmentation---RFM-Model

RFM Study Background: 
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is commonly used for customer segmentation.
This time, I will use a transactional dataset to perform a RFM Analysis.

For each Recency, Frequency and Monetary attributes, I split them to 4 groups:
Score with 4: Highest Score
           3: Better Score 
           2: Worse Score
           1: Lowest Score

Finally, based on RFM Model, I separate the customer to 10 groups:
0 The Best Customer
1 Loyal Customer
2 New Customer with High Spending
3 Potential Customer who is going to be lapsed
4 Potential Customer who only visit for a few time
5 Potential Customer with low spending
6 High Spending Customer need to pay more attention
7 New Customer with Low Spending
8 Low Spending Customer who visited frequently in the past
9 Low Spending Customer who is going to be lapsed
